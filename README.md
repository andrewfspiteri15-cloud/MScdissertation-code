Contains the code for the dissertation "A Study on Human Pose Classification Using Convolutional Neural Networks and Tensor Regression"

## CNN Application
Hyperparameter optimization for Trial A was done using Hyperparameter_Opt_TrialA.py, and for Trial B was done using Hyperparameter_Opt_TrialB.py. From there, we use ThreeDancersTrainingTest.py for Trial A and TrainingOnTwoDancers_TestOnOne.py for Trial B to run the optimal sets of hyperparameters.
